      <description>Although I&#39;m on Debian Linux, Apple&#39;s recent announcement about replacing Bash with Zsh on MacOS made me take a look at Z-shell aka zsh. It&#39;s a POSIX compliant Bash alternative that has been around for quite a long time.

      <description>Introduction Okay, here&#39;s a confession. I&#39;m the type of person who never picks up a new skill unless I absolutely have to. Although I have been using Debian based Linux personally and professionally for over a year, my knowledge on the command line and bash scripting have hopelessly remained stuck in a local minimum. Sure, I know my way around the terminal but working as a data scientist didn&#39;t require me to know the nitty-gritty details of bash scripting.</description>

      <description>Setting Up Installation This part describes a basic installation of a MySQL 5.7 database server on Ubuntu Linux, 18.04 to be specific.
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install mysql-server  Allow Remote Access If you want to connect to the MySQL database from another machine, you must open a port in your serverâ€™s firewall (the default port is 3306). This is not necessary if you intend to run the application that uses MySQL on the same server.</description>
