Although I'm on Debian Linux, Apple's recent announcement about replacing Bash with Zsh on MacOS made me take a look at Z-shell aka zsh. It's a [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant Bash alternative that has been around for quite a long time. While Bash shell's efficiency and ubiquity make it hard to think about changing the default shell of your primary development machine, I find its features as an interactive shell to be somewhat limited. So I did some digging around and soon found out that zsh's lackluster default configurations and bloated ecosystem make it difficult for someone who just want to switch without any extra overhead. So, let's make the process quicker. Here is what we are aiming for:

* A working shell that can (almost always) take bash commands without complaining (looking at you fish)
* History based autocomplete
* Syntax highlighting
* Git branch annotations

Instructions were applied and tested on debian based linux (Ubuntu)

## **Install Z Shell**

### **GNU/Linux**
To install on a debian based linux, type:

``` bash
$ apt install zsh
```

### **MacOS**

Use homebrew to install zsh on MacOs. Run:

``` bash
$ brew install zsh
```

## **Make Zsh as Your Default Shell**

Run:

``` bash
$ chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## **Install Oh-My-Zsh Framework**

[Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is the tool that makes zsh so much fun and overly configurable at the same time. So we'll tread here carefully. To install `oh-my-zsh` , type:

``` bash
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## **Set Agnoster Theme**

Agnoster is a fast and feature rich theme that ships with oh-my-zsh. To install agnoster:

* Run `nano ~/.zshrc`
* Set `ZSH_THEME="agnoster"`

## **Set Firacode As the Default Terminal Font**

Your selected theme may not display all the glyphs if the default terminal font doesn't support them. Installing a font with glyphs and ligature support can solve this. I recommend installing `firacode` and setting that as your default terminal font. Install Fira Code From [here.](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

## **Set Syntax Highlighting**

Using [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) to achieve this.

* Clone this repository in oh-my-zsh's plugins directory

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
  ```

* Activate the plugin in `~/.zshrc`

``` bash
  plugins=( [plugins...] zsh-syntax-highlighting)
  ```

* Source `~/.zshrc`

## **Set Suggestions**

Using [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) to achieve this.

* Clone this repository into $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins (by default ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins)

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
  ```

* Add the plugin to the list of plugins for Oh My Zsh to load (inside `~/.zshrc` )

``` bash
  plugins=(zsh-autosuggestions)
  ```

* Source `~/.zshrc`

Start a new terminal session to see the effects!!! You might need to log out and log in again for the changes to be effective.

## **Load .profile from .zprofile**

Add the following lines to `~/.zprofile` and source via the command:
`source ~/.zprofile`. Make sure you are on zsh before running the source command.

``` bash
[[ -e ~/.profile ]] && emulate sh -c 'source ~/.profile'
```

## **A Barebone ~/.zshrc**

Instead of adding the plugins individually, you can just install the plugins and then add this barebone config to your `~/.zshrc` . Don't forget to replace `YourUserName` with your username. Source your zshrc once you are done.

``` bash
# omz path
export ZSH="/home/rednafi/.oh-my-zsh"


# theme settings
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
DEFAULT_USER="rednafi"
prompt_context() {}

# pluging settings
plugins=(git zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions)

# autosuggestion highlight
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE="fg=4"

# source omz
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh


#History setup
HISTFILE=$HOME/.zsh_history
HISTSIZE=100000
SAVEHIST=$HISTSIZ

setopt hist_ignore_all_dups # remove older duplicate entries from history
setopt hist_reduce_blanks   # remove superfluous blanks from history items
setopt inc_append_history   # save history entries as soon as they are entered
setopt share_history        # share history between different instances of the shell
setopt auto_cd              # cd by typing directory name if it's not a command
setopt correct_all          # autocorrect commands
setopt auto_list            # automatically list choices on ambiguous completion
setopt auto_menu            # automatically use menu completion
setopt always_to_end        # move cursor to end if word had one match

zstyle ':completion:*' menu select
zstyle ':completion:*' group-name ''                                        # group results by category
zstyle ':completion:::::' completer _expand _complete _ignored _approximate #enable approximate matches for completion


```

## **Set Terminal Color (Optional)**
Optionally you customize your terminal color and in this case I've used [Gogh](http://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh) to achieve this.

  * Pre Install
  ```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install dconf-cli uuid-runtime
  ```
  * Install on Linux
  ```bash
   $ bash -c  "$(wget -qO- https://git.io/vQgMr)"
  ```
  * Install on MacOS
  ```bash
  $  bash -c  "$(curl -sLo- https://git.io/vQgMr)"
  ```

  * Put the code associated with your desired color scheme.

## **Updating OMZ**

``` bash
$ upgrade_oh_my_zsh
  ```

## **Uninstall Zsh**

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get --purge remove zsh
```

## **Uninstall OMZ**

``` bash
$ uninstall_oh_my_zsh
```

## **Switch Back to Bash**

``` bash
$ chsh -s $(which bash)
```
