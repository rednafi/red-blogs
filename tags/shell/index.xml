      <description>Although I&amp;rsquo;m on Debian Linux, Apple&amp;rsquo;s recent announcement about replacing Bash with Zsh on MacOS made me take a look at Z-shell aka zsh. It&amp;rsquo;s a POSIX compliant Bash alternative that has been around for quite a long time.

      <description>Introduction Okay, here&amp;rsquo;s a confession. I&amp;rsquo;m the type of person who never picks up a new skill unless I absolutely have to. Although I have been using Debian based Linux personally and professionally for over a year, my knowledge on the command line and bash scripting have hopelessly remained stuck in a local minimum. Sure, I know my way around the terminal but working as a data scientist didn&amp;rsquo;t require me to know the nitty-gritty details of bash scripting.</description>
